# RomCom  

### Abstract:
[//]: <>
We updated the framework of a website with javascript so that the included buttons are functional, users can generate random posters of 'Rom Coms', users can create their own 'Rom Coms', users can save the posters they like and they can also delete posters from the saved 'page.'

### Context:
[//]: <>
We worked on this project for about 22 hours but a lot of that was trial and error while trying to determine the correct methods and prototypes to use. We are two weeks into mod1 at Turing.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <>
Our learning goals were to get a better understanding of DOM and the relationship and workings between Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
VS Code and Dev tools were the main things we worked with in order to write and test our code. We used Javascript primarily to write the code but used CSS and HTML in order to find the elements and information to pull into our code. 
We used google, mdn, and w3 Schools a lot as well as Codepen and replit to test code or see how it was actually working.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <>
Wins:
We were able to work together well and explain things to eachother in other ways if the understanding wasn't there. Our communication was solid and every day we came with some fresh ideas and drive. We also were breaking up the monotony of coding with funny videos, jokes and mental checkins. 

Halfway through the project we came to a stretch of unproductive struggle and ended our night earlier then we had planned. The next day Chris came in and asked what he could do to be a better partner. We checked in and revisested what we had talked about in our norm document and set a new goal for ourselves about redirection and be more willing to explore new routes to a solution.

We were both unattached to the code we wrote and were willing to refactor different elements such as our naming conventions, organization, and functions in order to have cleaner more readable code. 

Challenges:
We were really challenged at first because we were stuck on an idea. When we first started we were trying to use getElementsByClass and spent too long as we didn't know about querySelector yet. We got some good information in class and were both open to taking a new direction with this. 

We were also challenged when we were tired and getting frustrated with a bug or the project as a whole. When we were at this place we were both good at taking a break and stepping away for a moment to get back on track and recenter ourselves.
